# aoc23-jl

This repo contains solutions for Advent of Code 2023 in Julia.

The twist is that everything will be done with macros.

This is intended as an educational exercise, rather than a serious attempt to complete the challenges.
Thus, there is no guarantee that this repository will ever contain solutions for all 50 stars.

## Usage

Clone the repository, then from its top-level directory, run:

```bash
julia --project=.
```

Then in the Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> using Aoc

julia> @day01
```
